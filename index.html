# QR Timestamps - Project Summary

## What It Is
**QR Timestamps** turns YouTube video timestamps into scannable QR codes. Each QR code has a number in the center (1, 2, 3...) and links directly to that section of the video.

**Tagline:** "Give more value to your timestamps"

## The Problem
- Creators already timestamp their videos
- But timestamps only work when you're already watching
- QR codes make timestamps work in physical space (manuals, stickers, presentations)

## Core Principles
1. **One QR per section** - each numbered
2. **Number in center** - scan QR with "4" → land on section 4
3. **What you see is where you go** - obvious, no explanation needed
4. **Leverage existing work** - scrape creator's timestamps first
5. **Creator stays in control** - AI fills form, human approves
6. **QR = scannable + clickable + shareable** - same image works three ways

## URL Structure
```
itabs.ai/v/[video-id]      → Menu of all sections
itabs.ai/v/[video-id]#1    → Section 1 directly
itabs.ai/v/[video-id]#2    → Section 2 directly
```

## What's Built (Working Prototype)
- ✅ Landing page with 6 sections from test video
- ✅ QR codes with numbers in center (generated via Python + via JavaScript)
- ✅ Navigation buttons that jump to timestamps
- ✅ YouTube embed that starts at correct timestamp
- ✅ URL hash support for direct section linking
- ✅ Downloadable QR code zip pack

**Test video used:** "5 Claudebot Use Cases" by Alex Finn
**Video ID:** `b-l9sGh1-UY`

## Files Created
- `/mnt/user-data/outputs/qr-timestamps-demo.html` - Working landing page
- `/mnt/user-data/outputs/qr-codes-claudebot.zip` - 6 QR code PNGs
- `/mnt/user-data/outputs/qr-timestamps-project-brief.md` - Full project spec

## Target Markets
1. **YouTube creators** (tech/tutorial) - already use timestamps
2. **Workplace training** - QR stickers on machines
3. **Documentation** - equipment manuals, guides

## Next Steps
1. Build the **Generator Tool** - paste YouTube URL → get landing page + QR codes
2. Auto-scrape timestamps from video descriptions
3. AI fallback if no timestamps exist
4. Creator branding (name, logo, channel link)
5. Test with real creators for feedback

## Technical Notes
- QR codes use high error correction (ERROR_CORRECT_H) to allow 30% coverage for the center number
- Python `qrcode` + PIL for generating PNGs
- JavaScript `QRCode.js` for browser-side generation
- YouTube IFrame API for timestamp embedding
